## üë®‚Äçüíª Projects:

### **Hospital Staff Management System Machine Learning Model**
**Technologies:** Python, pandas, numpy, scikit learn
- Designed and implemented a machine learning model to analyze hospital workforce data, identifying skill gaps, predicting staffing shortages, and recommending training needs.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and data preprocessing to ensure model accuracy and reliability.
- Evaluated multiple algorithms (Random Forest Regressor, Linear Regression, SVR) and selected Random Forest for optimal balance of accuracy (R¬≤ ‚âà 0.95), interpretability, and operational feasibility.
- Generated actionable insights for management by summarizing staffing distributions, predicting high-risk roles, and identifying training priorities.
- Created documentation and use cases to communicate system functionality and model results to non-technical stakeholders.
- Applied ethical considerations including data anonymization, fairness evaluation, and bias mitigation to ensure responsible model deployment.

### **Cryptotrack**

### **Student Roster System**
**Technologies:** C++
[View Project](https://github.com/TommyAshworth/Student_Roster_Management)
- Developed a C++ program to manage university student data for course rosters.
- Designed and implemented two classes (student and roster) to handle student information such as ID, name, email, age, and course completion times.
- Utilized dynamic memory management to create and manipulate student objects stored in an array (classRosterArray)
- Implemented functionality to filter, validate, and display student data, including average course completion time and degree program filtering.
- Ensured that the system handled data parsing and output to the console in a clean, efficient manner.
